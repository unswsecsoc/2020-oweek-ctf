### NOTES ###
iicsa.py file should run on server as cgi script, linked to from ctfd page.
pass\_check.py in /files is only for them to read

### HOW TO SOLVE ###
1. read provided pass\_check.py file to extract ENCODED\_PASS array and decode functions
2. execute decode on ENCODED\_PASS to get required password (or do it in your head like a madman). password is 'pl3a2E\_4Nd\_7h4NkY0u'
3. put that password into the website and click go. it should respond with the flag
